-Revert "New phosphor persistence shaders for HLSL" Reverts mamedev/mame#1843 [rb6502]

-New machine: Atari PC1; name correction: Atari PC3; gave standard pccga five slots, so machines with combo cards can have harddisks
 as well until combo cards are emulated; reordered MCFG and ROM entries to match the machine list at the bottom of the file;
 deriving PC4i configuration instead of creating it new; 720K drives standard for laptops which have them; info on Zenith
 Supersport, Bondwell Pro28 and Atari PCs [rfka01]

-Added info on several already emulated systems in the header. Corrected number of slots for PC4i and detailed information on Data
 General One, Commodore PC-1, Commodere PC10-III and PC20-III, Zenith SuperSport, Siemens Sicomp PC16-05, NCR PC4i, Olivetti M15,
 Sharp PC-7000, Sanyo MBC-16, Atari PC-3, Eagle 1600, VTech Laser Turbo XT and XT/3 [rfka01]

-new WORKING game - Hangzo (Japan, prototype) [ShouTime (+others)]

-Add more softlist documentation based off new dumps Carts for a2600, megadriv, n64 and snes got redumped recently by TeamEurope.
 Add in newfound information from those dumps to the softlists. [FakeShemp]
 * Also remove syvalionp2 as it's simply a bad dump of syvalionp.

-V.Smile - Update the software lists A bunch of updates for the vsmile_cart software list. [FakeShemp]
 * The softlist have been split into three lists. One for regular V.Smile, one for V.Smile Motion, and one for V.Smile Baby. Neither
    the Motion or Baby lists are hooked up yet though.
 * The list of carts in the XML has been updated with a bunch of new-found carts and been restructured to indicate which carts are
    undumped.
 * The cart internals have been documented more thoroughly. The descriptions now list PCB types, chip placements/labels etc, if
    available.
 * Previously missed dumps have been added as well.
 * Some typos have been fixed.

-punkywil: Added a ridiculously incomplete dump of the CPU ROM. [AJR, Akiles500]

we've been sitting on this for a while, progress was shown a few years ago, but is apparently lost.  Smitdogg should be able to
  clarify the exact part numbers, they're not readable in the pictures. [mamehaze]
ARM core is better than it was a few years ago too, so might actually work better if hooked up again now. [mamehaze]
### Major Changes [anikom15]
Two types of phosphor persistence models for raster and vector screens [anikom15]
Separate persistence model for LCDs [anikom15]
Update the presets to work with the new shaders. [anikom15]
### Explanation [anikom15]
There are two basic responses for phosphor persistence: exponential and inverse power. You can't combine the two; you have to commit
  to one. Exponential is simpler and is designed for displays that use short phosphors like black and white television. It uses one
  parameter, tau, which increases the persistence. Inverse power is for longer persistences, and can be made to have a long tail
  while keeping a fast initial decay. The two parameters are beta and gamma. Beta is the power, from 0.5 to 2. Lower beta means a
  slower decay and (much) longer persistence, with gamma 1, a power of 0.5 will persist for over 18 hr., while a power of 2 will
  persist for only 15 s. Gamma is a time constant. Higher gamma means a faster decay and shorter persistence. These constants can be
  set individually for red, green, and blue subpixels. The mode has a slider and the subpixels each have three sliders for the three
  constants. [anikom15]
LCD persistence uses the exponential model. This makes sense because the response is basically an asymmetric capacitor. LCDs don't
  have individual responses for their red, green, and blue subpixels, and so there is just one slider. [anikom15]
I will try to port this to BGFX although I am even more unfamiliar with that than I am with HLSL. Please let me know if you have any
  problems or ideas. [anikom15]
